            "reasoning": "**Defining the Concept**\n\nI've got the product nailed down: premium noise-canceling headphones. Now, I'm diving into the concept. It's all about transforming that crazy commute into a personal oasis, a \"day in the life\" story with a cinematic feel. I'm aiming for a six-scene JSON format to tell the story.\n\n\n**Refining the Narrative**\n\nI've decided on a single-shot mode, with each scene requiring a `motion` field instead of transitions. I've broken down the narrative into a six-scene arc, starting with the chaos of a busy subway and ending with a hero shot of the headphones. I'm focusing on visual cues to imply the change in sound. I'm refining my mental outline of each scene now. For example, Scene 3 will feature a shift to warm lighting to portray audio isolation.\n\n\n**Visualizing the Scenes**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in envisioning the scenes. Scene 1 will set the stage with a crowded subway. Scene 2 zooms in on the headphones, while Scene 3 introduces warmer lighting. Scenes 4 and 5 follow with a coffee shop and golden hour city walk. Finally, I'll end with a product shot. The prompts are cinematic, and I've planned the specific motions for each.\n\n\n**Developing the Aesthetics**\n\nI'm deep in the visual details. Scene 2 needs dramatic side lighting and cinematic color grading. Scene 3 is taking shape with golden lighting and a dreamlike feel. I'm imagining a slow dolly zoom with a vertigo effect on the protagonist. Scene 4 is becoming an over-the-shoulder shot in a cozy coffee shop. I have also decided on rain streaming down the window pane, and steam rising from a coffee cup.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Scenes**\n\nI'm solidifying the final scenes now. Scene 5 will be a low-angle tracking shot, perfectly capturing a golden-hour city walk. I've designed Scene 6 as a studio product shot, highlighting the headphones' features with a slow, elegant rotation. I'm focusing on ensuring these final scenes maintain the consistent cinematic style. Now, I'm constructing the fields, ensuring each part is perfect for the JSON format.\n\n\n",

Uses Space Grotesk typography and follows the exact 10s/30fps timing and color palette specified.\",\"writtenToSandbox\":true,\"reasoning\":\"**Remotion Project: Initial Setup Deep Dive**\\n\\nOkay, so I'm diving into this Remotion project, `initial_setup`, and it's all starting to gel. The goal is to create a dynamic intro sequence for \\\"Koda\\\".  First things first: the aesthetic. I've got a tight design spec to work with: a stark palette – `#050505` for the background, electric cyan (`#00F0FF`), vivid purple (`#7000FF`) as primary and accent colors, and stark white (`#FFFFFF`) for text.  Typography is `Space Grotesk` (Bold), sized at a hefty 120px for the logo. Motion is key, especially the logo's snap-in, which will use a spring effect (`{ damping: 12, stiffness: 200 }`).  Then there are the particles: over 200 small circular particles radiating outwards.  They'll have randomized velocities, float without gravity, and be motion-blurred for a soft effect.  A heavy bloom/glow effect (using `drop-shadow`) will be applied to the logo, and an animated grid background with low opacity will add a subtle layer of visual interest.\\n\\nMy strategy involves four distinct scenes: \\\"The Void\\\", \\\"The Reveal\\\", \\\"Particle Drift\\\", and \\\"Fade Out\\\", each contributing to the 10-second (300 frames at 30fps) animation. Scene 1, \\\"The Void\\\" (0-60 frames), starts with the grid gradually appearing and a central light source emerging. \\\"The Reveal\\\" (60-150) is where the \\\"Koda\\\" logo springs into view, accompanied by a particle explosion. \\\"Particle Drift\\\" (150-240) centers the logo as the particles drift outwards. And finally, \\\"Fade Out\\\" (240-300), where everything dissolves.\\n\\nProject structure is critical. I'm breaking things down into clear components: `src/Root.tsx` to handle the overall composition, `src/Video.tsx` for the main container including background and grid. The sequence logic is in `src/sequences/MainSequence.tsx`, and the visual elements are modularized: `src/components/Logo.tsx` for the \\\"Koda\\\" logo (spring, glow), `src/components/Particles.tsx` for the particle system, and `src/components/Grid.tsx` for the animated grid.\\n\\nNow, let's get into the specifics. For the *Grid*, I'm leaning towards a repeating linear gradient or an SVG pattern, animating its opacity and possibly a slight movement. For the *Logo*, it's \\\"KODA\\\" in `Space Grotesk`, sized at 120px, with white text, and a heavy glow achieved through stacked `drop-shadow` filters. The spring animation is ready to go with the configuration from the design spec. The *Particles* are where the magic happens. I'll pre-calculate random angles and speeds for each particle using `useMemo` to keep things performant. I'll use `interpolate` and `spring` to move them outwards from the center and add a slight drift from frames 150-240. Also, these particles need to be motion-blurred via a blur filter.\\n\\nAs I build, I'm making sure my timing is correct, setting grid animation from 0-300 with its fade-in from 0-60. Logo enters at frame 60 and particles are triggered at frame 60.\\n\\nI'll configure my `Root.tsx` with a 1920x1080 resolution, 30fps, and 300 frames. The `Video.tsx` will have a `#050505` background. The `Grid.tsx` will use linear gradients as the `backgroundImage` with an opacity of 0.1. The `Logo.tsx` uses `SpaceGrotesk`, is 120px, and has a white color. The glow effect will be `drop-shadow(0 0 15px #00F0FF) drop-shadow(0 0 30px #7000FF)`. Lastly, the `Particles.tsx` will manage 250 particles, each with a random angle and max distance.\\n\\nMy scene logic is clear now. In *Scene 1 (0-60)*, the grid ramps up from 0 to 0.1 opacity. A central glow (radial gradient) animates from 0 to 1. *Scene 2 (60-150)* involves the logo scaling from 0 to 1 with a spring effect, and the particle explosion from the center. *Scene\\n\\n\"}"

The goal is to correct how the `SpaceGrotesk` font is loaded using `@remotion/google-fonts`. Specifically, the current code's `loadFont` call seems off. It's trying to pass `fontWeight` directly, and that's usually not the correct syntax according to my experience with these libraries. I'm pretty sure it needs the `weights` property as an array, as per `@remotion/google-fonts` best practices.\\n\\nThe design specs are clear: background #050505, electric cyan (#00F0FF) primary, vivid purple (#7000FF) accent, and #FFFFFF for text. The font is `Space Grotesk` at 120px, bold, with a spring animation (`{ damping: 12, stiffness: 200 }`) and a glow effect using `drop-shadow`.\\n\\nThe current problematic code looks like this:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { loadFont } from \\\"@remotion/google-fonts/SpaceGrotesk\\\";\\nconst { fontFamily } = loadFont({ fontWeight: '700' }); // This is the line to fix\\n```\\n\\nI need to change that line. I've reviewed the Remotion Google Fonts API documentation and the correct way to specify font weights (for a single weight) is:\\n\\n```tsx\\nloadFont({ weights: [\\\"700\\\"] });\\n```\\n\\nTherefore, the change I need to make is to modify the import statement and that specific line to:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { loadFont } from \\\"@remotion/google-fonts/SpaceGrotesk\\\";\\nconst { fontFamily } = loadFont({ weights: [\\\"700\\\"] });\\n```\\n\\nAll other aspects of the component, including the styling, spring animation, and glow effect, should remain completely untouched. Essentially, the corrected component will be:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { loadFont } from \\\"@remotion/google-fonts/SpaceGrotesk\\\";\\nconst { fontFamily } = loadFont({ weights: [\\\"700\\\"] });\\n```\\n\\nThe component's core design elements remain the same: color palette (#00F0FF, #7000FF, #FFFFFF), typography (Space Grotesk, 120px), and the spring animation (`{ damping: 12, stiffness: 200 }`) with the glow effect, which will be maintained.

I need to get rid of the `loadFont` import for \\\"Space Grotesk\\\" and the `fontFamily` definition that goes with it. Then, I need to update the inline style object to use the system font stack. Specifically, I'll update `fontFamily` to be `'Inter', 'system-ui', sans-serif`.\\n\\nI'll keep the `entrance` spring animation which depends on the current `frame` and `fps`. Also the floating effect defined by `float` and the glow effect that is defined by `glow` must remain untouched.\\nThe styling for the text, `fontSize: 120`, `fontWeight: 'bold'`, `color: '#FFFFFF'`, `textTransform: 'uppercase'`, `letterSpacing: '0.1em'`, `transform: scale(${entrance}) translateY(${float}px)`, and `filter: drop-shadow(...)`, all remain as they are. The changes should be clean and precise, respecting the constraints.\\n\\nFinally, I've confirmed that the resultant code is valid JSON and complete. There are no placeholders, and the design specification is followed.  The google-fonts dependency has been successfully removed, with the system font stack integrated. The updated component is ready.\\n\\n\\n\"}"

Includes a smooth transition of the brand name to the left third and a final red accent line reveal.\",\"writtenToSandbox\":true,\"reasoning\":\"**Remotion Project: Sonos Reveal Animation - Initial Setup and Implementation**\\n\\nAlright, let's break down this Remotion project for a Sonos reveal. The goal is a 10-second animation (300 frames at 30fps), a sleek, kinetic typography piece with a product reveal. My immediate thoughts center on structuring the core components and defining the animations.\\n\\nFirst, I need to configure the foundational elements. `Root.tsx` will house the main `Composition` with the ID \\\"SonosReveal,\\\" defining the project's properties and duration. `Video.tsx` is the primary container, setting the `#000000` (pure black) background with `AbsoluteFill` and loading the Montserrat font. I'll need `@remotion/google-fonts` to get that working smoothly.\\n\\nThe core of the animation logic resides in `MainSequence.tsx`. This orchestrates three distinct scenes:\\n\\n*   **Scene 1 (0-90 frames):** \\\"Sonos\\\" text fades in, centered, with expanding tracking (letter spacing).\\n*   **Scene 2 (90-210 frames):** The text slides to the left (about a third of the width), and the product image fades in on the right with a Ken Burns zoom (1.0 to 1.08 scale).\\n*   **Scene 3 (210-300 frames):** A red accent line (#EF4444) appears under the text and smoothly expands, and then a final fade to black occurs from frame 270.\\n\\nI'll be using separate components for the animated elements:\\n\\n*   `BrandText.tsx`:  Handles the \\\"Sonos\\\" text animation: the opacity fade-in, the letter spacing growth, and the smooth slide to the left using `spring` for the movement.\\n*   `HeroProduct.tsx`: Manages the product image fade-in and the Ken Burns effect using `interpolate` for the scale.\\n*   `AccentLine.tsx`: Controls the red underline's width expansion.\\n\\nKey animations will be driven by `interpolate` for fades (opacity, scale) and spring for the position transition in BrandText. The design spec dictates Montserrat (Bold, 700), 120px text, the specified red (#EF4444) accent line, a smooth Ken Burns effect, and a defined spring config `{ damping: 25, stiffness: 90 }`. I have the necessary media file already: `staticFile(\\\"media/scene_6__the_hero_object__d0zl1x1.png\\\")`.\\n\\nTo ensure correct positioning, I'll calculate the exact horizontal position for the \\\"Sonos\\\" text based on the requirement to slide to the \\\"left third.\\\" Also, the red line will be positioned relative to the text. The final fade out from 270-300 should be implemented on the root level of the video or the container component that holds all of the elements in the animation.\\n\\nHere's the plan for the animations, refined during thinking:\\n\\n*   **`BrandText.tsx`:**  Frame 0-90: Centered, opacity 0->1, spacing 0->10px; Frame 90-120: Transition to the left, using a spring effect; Frame 120-300: Stays left.\\n*   **`HeroProduct.tsx`:**  Frame 0-90: Hidden (opacity 0); Frame 90-120: Fade in (opacity 0->1), Scale 1.0 -> 1.08; Frame 90-300: Scale 1.0 -> 1.08.\\n*   **`AccentLine.tsx`:** Frame 0-210: Hidden; Frame 210-240: Width expands.\\n\\nI've got the essentials in place – the design, the layout, and the core components. Now I can begin code implementation.\\n\\n\\n\"}"

I'm targeting a 10-second duration within a 16:9 aspect ratio. The scene will also include the image `scene_6__the_hero_object__d0zl1x1` as edge media. I'm exploring different easing functions to achieve the optimal visual effect for the fade-in.\n\n\n**Defining the Scene's Details**\n\nI've specified the image - a striking product shot of noise-canceling headphones, and the desired visual style; kinetic typography with a minimal aesthetic, focusing on generous whitespace, a monochrome palette with a red accent, and clean sans-serif fonts. I'm thinking of subtle animations with low-stiffness, high-damping springs for a smooth motion. I'm using black, white, and red for the color palette, and Montserrat for the \"Sonos\" text.\n\n\n**Refining the Scene Plan**\n\nI'm now iterating on the scene breakdown. The initial plan has been simplified to focus on three distinct scenes: an intro with fading \"Sonos\" text, a scene featuring the headphones, and a final brand lockup. I'll need to call `analyze_prompt` to provide feedback on the inferred style. Next step, `generate_plan`.\n\n\n",
